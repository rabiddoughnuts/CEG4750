The loss of the space shuttle Columbia with seven astronauts on board 
on Saturday was the most serious incident in NASA's shuttle program 
since the 1986 explosion of the Challenger, in which seven astronauts died. 

The following are landmark missions in the NASA Space Shuttle program. 

1981, Apr 12-14 -- The space shuttle Columbia is launched from 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to begin the first shuttle mission. I
ts primary objectives were to accomplish a safe ascent into orbit, 
check all flight systems and carry out a safe landing. 
After landing it was found that a take-off pressure wave had 
displaced 16 heat shield tiles and damaged 148 others. 

1981, Nov 12 -- Columbia undertook the second shuttle mission, 
shortened from five to three days due to fuel cell failure, 
after several launch delays. NASA said 90 percent of mission 
objectives had been achieved. 

1982-85 -- Shuttles make 20 missions into orbit and back. 

1983 June 18-24 -- First U.S. woman astronaut, Sally Ride, 
takes part in NASA's seventh shuttle mission, on board Challenger. 

1986, Jan 28 -- The shuttle Challenger explodes 72 seconds after 
take-off, killing the seven crew, including the schoolteacher 
Sharon C. McAuliffe. Blast caused by a leak of liquid hydrogen. 
Shuttle flights were halted while extensive investigation into accident 
and assessment of Shuttle program were conducted. 

1988, Sep 29-Oct 3 -- The shuttle Discovery marks resumption 
of flights after 1986 disaster. 

1989, May 4-8 -- The shuttle Atlantis successfully releases payload, the Magellan spacecraft, for radar mapping of Venus. 

1990, April 24-29 -- Discovery deploys the Hubble Space Telescope (news - web sites) into orbit. 

1995 June 27-Jul 7 -- Atlantis marks the 100th U.S. human space launch with first docking between Shuttle and Russian Mir space station (news - web sites), ferrying Russian cosmonauts to and from the station. Dockings with Mir continue through 1996, 1997 until February 1998. 

1998 Dec 4-15 -- Endeavour makes the first International Space Station (news - web sites) (ISS) flight to attach the first two modules of the ISS. ISS assembly flights and crew exchange flights continue through 1999, 2000 and 2001. 

2002 Nov-Dec -- Endeavour exchanges the ISS's fifth and sixth mission crews in a 14-day mission in orbit. It marks Endeavour's 19th flight. 

2003 Feb 1 -- Columbia, the 113th shuttle mission, carrying Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli in space, breaks up over Texas with seven astronauts on board after 16 days in orbit.
